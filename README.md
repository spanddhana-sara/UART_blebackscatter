<h1><strong>BeagleBone PRU Backscatter - BLE Advertisements with UART Input</strong></h1>

This project enables Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisement backscatter on BeagleBone using PRUs (Programmable Real-time Units) with serial input from UART. It captures UART data and transmits it as BLE advertisements.


<h2><strong>Project Overview</strong></h2>

This project leverages the BeagleBoneâ€™s PRU to backscatter BLE advertisements, utilizing data received from a UART device. The data is sent through BLE advertisements after being read from a serial input. The advertisements can be repeated multiple times for optimal performance.

<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>
* PRU-based backscatter BLE advertisements using UART input.
* BLE advertisement repetition for robust communication.
* Configurable MAC address and UART settings.
* Real-time BLE advertisement transmission based on incoming serial data.
